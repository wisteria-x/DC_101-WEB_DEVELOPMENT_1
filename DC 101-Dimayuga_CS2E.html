    <h1>White Horse <br> by: Taylor Swift</h1>
    <p>Say you're sorry, that face of an angel <br>
    Comes out just when you need it to<br>
    As I paced back and forth all this time<br>
    'Cause I honestly believed in you<br>
    Holdin' on, the days drag on<br>
    Stupid girl, I should've known, I should've known</p>
    
    <p>That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale <br>
    I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet <br>
    Lead her up the stairwell<br>
    This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town<br>
    I was a dreamer before you went and let me down<br>
    
    <p style="text-align: center">
    Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes<br>
    And never really had a chance<br>
    My mistake, I didn't know to be in love<br>
    You had to fight to have the upper hand<br>
    I had so many dreams about you and me<br>
    Happy endings, now I know<br>
    I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale<br>
    I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet<br>
    Lead her up the stairwell<br>
    This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town<br>
    I was a dreamer before you went and let me down<br>
    Now it's too late for you and your white horse<br>
    To come around<br>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
    And there you are on your knees<br>
    Begging for forgiveness, begging for me<br>
    Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry<br>
    'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale<br>
    I'm gonna find someone someday<br>
    Who might actually treat me well<br>
    This is a big world, that was a small town<br>
    There in my rear-view mirror disappearing now<br>
    And it's too late for you and your white horse<br>
    Now it's too late for you and your white horse<br>
    To catch me now<br>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
    Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
    Try and catch me now, oh<br>
    It's too late<br>
    To catch me now<br>
     </p>
